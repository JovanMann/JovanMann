### Hi 👋, I'm Jovan!

I’m 21 years old from London, currently in my final year at university studying BSc Mathematics & Economics. My journey into Data Analytics started early 2020 teaching myself how to code and create queries on SQL, Python, and other programming languages. Since then, I have completed various projects displaying my willingness to continuously learn and develop. My other interests outside of data involve sports and travelling.
