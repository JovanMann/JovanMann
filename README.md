Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jovan!   

Iâ€™m 21 years old from London, currently in my final year at university studying BSc Mathematics & Economics. My journey into Data Analytics started early 2020 teaching myself how to code and create queries on SQL, Python, and other programming languages. Since then, I have completed various projects displaying my willingness to continuously learn and develop. My other interests outside of data involve sports and travelling.   

I am available for work. Please reach out to me through my LinkedIn for any questions that you may have or any available and relevant positions that you are hiring for. Thank you.
